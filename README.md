# OraCrew_KPA
This is our first time competing in hackathon and had lots of fun in joining this Competition, we hope to be part of the future hackathons for Oracle Community, 
let me tell you a bit of background for our application:

Our application “Klima Pythia Analytika” – weather forecast application aims to provide accurate weather prediction for the F1 Racing Video Game

We used OCI to provision the environments for the oracle applications needed to create the “Klima Pythia Analytika” – weather forecast application, 
we built the weather forecast application with Oracle Machine Learning + Oracle Analytics Cloud for data science and data visualization, 
and call them using Apex for our User Interface, as for our database we used ADW to load and store our data.
